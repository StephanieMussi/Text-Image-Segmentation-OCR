# Text_Image_Segmentation_OCR
This project aims to recognize texts in imaged documents with Tesseract OCR. Different thresholding algorithms including Otsu global thresholding and adaptive thresholding are applied. Besides, image enhancement techniques such as histogram equalization, gamma correction and spatial filters are asopted to enhance the accuracy of recognition.
